# AI Requirements Understanding & Documentation Problem

## Date: 2025-06-28

## Problem Description
AI tools may interpret requirements differently than intended, leading to implementation mismatches. There's a need for mechanisms to document AI's understanding and potentially reverse-engineer requirements from existing code.

## Key Issues
1. **Interpretation Gaps**: AI may understand requirements differently than human intent
2. **Lost Context**: Original requirements context gets lost between prompt and implementation
3. **Undocumented Assumptions**: AI makes implicit assumptions that aren't captured
4. **Requirements Drift**: Code evolves but original requirements aren't traceable
5. **Reverse Engineering Need**: Difficulty extracting actual requirements from implemented code

## Specific Challenges
- No standardized way to capture AI's interpretation of requirements
- Missing link between natural language requirements and code implementation
- Inability to verify if code matches original intent
- No audit trail of requirement understanding

## Potential Solutions to Explore
1. **AI Interpretation Documentation**
   - Require AI to explicitly state its understanding before coding
   - Create structured format for documenting interpretations
   - Version control for requirement interpretations

2. **Requirements Traceability**
   - Link code sections to specific requirements
   - Maintain requirement-to-code mapping
   - Use comments or metadata to preserve intent

3. **Reverse Engineering Tools**
   - Tools to extract behavior specifications from code
   - Generate requirements documentation from implementation
   - Compare extracted requirements with original specs

4. **Verification Mechanisms**
   - Human review of AI's requirement interpretation
   - Test cases that validate requirement understanding
   - Continuous alignment checks between code and requirements
