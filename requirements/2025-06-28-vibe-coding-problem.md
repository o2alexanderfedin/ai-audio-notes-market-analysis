# AI-Assisted Vibe Coding Problem Statement

## Date: 2025-06-28

## Problem Description
Many people are engaging in "vibe coding" using AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) - generating code through AI prompts without understanding the underlying logic, structure, or implications of what the AI produces.

## Key Issues
1. **Blind Trust in AI Output**: Developers accept and use AI-generated code without understanding what it actually does
2. **No Code Reading or Review**: Skipping the critical step of reading and understanding AI-generated code before integrating it
3. **Copy-Paste Without Comprehension**: Directly using AI suggestions without understanding their purpose, side effects, or appropriate use cases
4. **Prompt-and-Pray Development**: Repeatedly prompting AI until something "works" without understanding why or how
5. **Loss of Fundamental Skills**: Developers becoming dependent on AI without building core programming knowledge

## Potential Consequences
- Hidden bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities from unchecked AI code
- Performance issues from inefficient AI solutions
- Inability to debug or maintain AI-generated code
- Knowledge gaps becoming critical weaknesses
- Brittle systems built on misunderstood foundations
- Legal/licensing issues from AI-generated code

## Possible Solutions to Explore
- AI code review guidelines and best practices
- Requiring explanation and understanding of AI-generated code
- Educational programs on responsible AI tool usage
- Code comprehension requirements before integration
- Mentorship on working with AI as a tool, not a replacement
- Tools to analyze and explain AI-generated code
- Policies requiring human understanding of all production code
