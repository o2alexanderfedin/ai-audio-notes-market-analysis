**Category:** Solo Entrepreneur  
**Location:** Kampong Glam, Singapore

## Background
A 45-year-old Malay Singaporean who runs a halal meal prep service from a shared kitchen in Ubi. Ahmad previously worked as a chef at Marina Bay Sands for 12 years before starting his own business in 2021. He graduated from Temasek Polytechnic with a diploma in Culinary Arts and later completed part-time business courses at SUSS.

## Business Context
Ahmad operates "Sedap Meal Prep," delivering healthy halal meals to busy professionals and fitness enthusiasts. He manages weekly subscriptions for about 150 customers across Singapore, with plans to expand to JB and Batam. Currently handles orders through WhatsApp Business and delivers using GrabExpress and Lalamove.

## NoCode Usage
Uses WhatsApp Business for order taking and Excel for meal planning. Recently started using Square for payments but struggles to integrate it with his ordering system. His daughter helped him set up a basic Wix website, but it's not connected to his operations.

## Pain Points
- "Every Sunday night, I spend 4 hours just sorting out orders for the week"
- Different customers have different dietary restrictions - tracking manually is "pening" (headache-inducing)
- No system to manage delivery slots and routes efficiently
- Cannot easily upsell or suggest add-ons to existing customers
- Difficulty managing supplier orders based on weekly demand

## Desired Outcomes
- Automated meal selection system with dietary filters (keto, diabetes-friendly, high-protein)
- Integration between ordering platform and delivery scheduling
- Subscription management with pause/resume options
- Automated ingredient ordering based on weekly subscriptions
- Multi-language support (English, Malay, Mandarin) for elder customers

## Budget & Timeline
- Budget: SGD 200-300/month for digital tools
- Timeline: Urgent - needs solution before Ramadan rush (3 months)
- Can dedicate weekends to learning new system
- Looking for ROI within 6 months of implementation

## Success Metrics
- Reduce Sunday planning time from 4 hours to 1 hour
- Increase customer base from 150 to 300 within 6 months
- Achieve 90% customer retention rate (currently 70%)
- Expand delivery to 2 new areas without hiring additional staff
- Generate SGD 80,000 monthly revenue (currently SGD 45,000)
