**Location:** Tiong Bahru, Singapore

## Background
Former marketing manager at DBS Bank who left her corporate job after 8 years to pursue her passion for sustainable fashion. Rachel graduated from NUS Business School in 2012 and worked her way up the corporate ladder before taking the leap into entrepreneurship during the pandemic. As a Chinese Singaporean, she's deeply connected to both traditional values and modern sustainability movements.

## Business Context
Rachel runs an online boutique selling curated sustainable fashion from Southeast Asian designers. She operates from her HDB flat, managing everything from sourcing to social media marketing. Her business model focuses on Instagram and TikTok sales, with monthly pop-ups at local markets like *Boutique Fairs* and Public Garden.

## NoCode Usage
Currently uses Shopify for her online store but struggles with customization limitations. She relies on Canva for social media content and Google Sheets for inventory tracking. Recently started exploring Airtable after attending a workshop at One North but finds the learning curve steep.

## Pain Points
- "Cannot afford to hire developer lah, but Shopify templates all look the same"
- Manually copying orders between WhatsApp, Instagram DMs, and Shopify
- Tracking inventory across multiple platforms is "super leceh" (troublesome)
- No automated way to manage pre-orders and waitlists
- Difficulty creating a custom size recommendation tool for Asian body types

## Desired Outcomes
- Unified dashboard showing orders from all channels (WhatsApp, IG, website)
- Automated inventory sync between online store and pop-up events
- Custom product recommendation engine based on customer preferences
- Integrated shipping calculator for regional orders (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand)
- Automated customer service responses in multiple languages

## Budget & Timeline
- Budget: SGD 300-500/month for tools
- Timeline: Needs solution within 2 months before year-end sale season
- Willing to invest 10-15 hours learning new platform
- ROI expectation: 30% reduction in manual work within 3 months

## Success Metrics
- Reduce order processing time from 20 minutes to 5 minutes
- Increase repeat customer rate from 25% to 40%
- Expand to 3 new Southeast Asian markets within 6 months
- Achieve SGD 50,000 monthly revenue (currently at SGD 30,000)
- Automate 80% of customer inquiries

## Quotes
"I need something that my part-time helper aunty can also use when I'm at pop-ups. Cannot be too cheem (complicated) you know?"

"Every tool wants USD pricing, but my customers think in SGD. The currency conversion display alone is giving me headache."

"Want to expand to Indonesia and Thailand, but each market has different size standards and payment methods. How to manage without hiring more people?"
