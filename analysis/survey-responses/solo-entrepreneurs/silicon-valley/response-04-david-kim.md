**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"I'm skeptical about AI understanding the nuances of hardware consulting. My business isn't just services - it's complex engineering projects with IP considerations. Would need to see it handle technical service businesses specifically. Voice input isn't that important to me - I prefer written documentation. What would be valuable is help with proposal writing and project scoping. Also need guidance on transitioning from project-based to retainer models."
