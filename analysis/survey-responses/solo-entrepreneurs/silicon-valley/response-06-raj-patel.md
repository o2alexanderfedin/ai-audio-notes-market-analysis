**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"As someone who builds ML systems, I'm naturally skeptical of AI-generated insights. Would need to see the methodology and data sources. Voice input isn't appealing - I think better when writing. What would be valuable is deep technical market analysis for ML/AI services. Help me understand how to package expertise into products. Also need guidance on building a team while maintaining quality. Consider API access so I can integrate into my existing analytical workflows."
