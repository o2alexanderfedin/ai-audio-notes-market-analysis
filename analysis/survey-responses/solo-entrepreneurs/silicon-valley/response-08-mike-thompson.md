**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"I've used many business analysis tools over the years. Most are too generic for DTC. Need something that understands Amazon algorithms, Facebook ad costs, supply chain complexities, and sustainability metrics. Voice input is nice but not essential - I care more about DTC-specific insights. Would be interested if it can help with exit planning and brand valuation. Integration with Shopify and Amazon Seller Central data would be killer."
