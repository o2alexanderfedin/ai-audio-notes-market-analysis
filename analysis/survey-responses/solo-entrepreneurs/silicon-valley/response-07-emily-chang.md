**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"This could really help bridge my legal expertise with business strategy needs. I'm particularly interested in market validation features since legal tech is so niche. Privacy and confidentiality are paramount - would need strong data protection guarantees. Would love integration with user research tools to analyze interview transcripts. The ability to understand regulatory constraints would set this apart from generic business tools. Please consider legal tech as a specific vertical!"
