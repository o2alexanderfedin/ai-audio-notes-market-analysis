I particularly need help with go-to-market strategy and competitive positioning. Please make sure it understands technical SaaS businesses - not just generic business advice. API access would be amazing for integrating into my workflow. Also, privacy is critical - I'd need assurance that my ideas are encrypted and never used to train models."
