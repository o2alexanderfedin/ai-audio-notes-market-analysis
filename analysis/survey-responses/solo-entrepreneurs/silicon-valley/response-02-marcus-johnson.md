**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"Look, I'm bootstrapping hard and every dollar counts. I need something that helps me scale without breaking the bank. Love the voice input idea - I'm always on the go between client calls. Make it mobile-first please! Also, would be dope if it could analyze my competitors' pricing from their websites. Keep it simple and actionable - I don't need MBA-level reports, just tell me what to do next to grow."
