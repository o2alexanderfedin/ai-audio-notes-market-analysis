**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"Coming from McKinsey, I'm used to rigorous analysis but startup pace is completely different. I need something that bridges that gap - fast but thorough. The tool should understand B2B SaaS metrics deeply (CAC, LTV, churn, etc.). Would love to see benchmarking against similar companies. Privacy is important but not my top concern - I care more about accuracy and actionability. Consider adding scenario planning features for fundraising vs bootstrapping paths."
