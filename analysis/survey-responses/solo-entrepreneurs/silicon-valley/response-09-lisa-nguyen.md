**Any additional comments or suggestions?**
"As a researcher transitioning to entrepreneurship, I need help bridging the gap between science and business. The ability to input research findings and get business implications would be invaluable. Healthcare is so regulated - understanding compliance requirements is crucial. I love the voice input idea for processing thoughts after reading papers. Please ensure it can handle technical/medical terminology. Integration with PubMed or research databases would be amazing. Help me speak 'business' to investors while maintaining scientific rigor!"
