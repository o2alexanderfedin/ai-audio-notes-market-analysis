## Section 9: Open Feedback

27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "An AI that understands technical context and can help translate between deep technical assessments and executive strategy. It should be able to identify patterns across engagements while maintaining strict client confidentiality. Most importantly, it needs to help me scale my expertise - capturing the nuances of why certain AI implementations fail and others succeed."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "Multi-stakeholder discovery sessions where I'm assessing an enterprise's AI readiness. Currently, I miss important cultural and organizational cues while focusing on technical architecture discussions. An AI assistant could capture both layers and help me identify the human factors that often determine AI project success."

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**
    "Any doubt about data security or client segregation. My enterprise clients have zero tolerance for data leaks. Also, if the AI doesn't understand technical context well enough to distinguish between similar-sounding but fundamentally different architectures."

30. **What integration capabilities are essential?**
    "Integration with Notion for my knowledge base, Jupyter notebooks for technical documentation, and the ability to export to client-standard formats (PowerPoint, Word). API access would be crucial for building custom workflows around my assessment framework."
