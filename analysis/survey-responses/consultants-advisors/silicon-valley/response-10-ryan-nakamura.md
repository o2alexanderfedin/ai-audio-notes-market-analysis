## Section 9: Open Feedback

27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "An AI that understands technical architecture and can help me identify risks and inconsistencies across multiple stakeholder interviews. It should recognize when different team members give conflicting technical information and help me dig deeper. The ability to translate technical findings into investor-friendly risk assessments is crucial."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "Technical deep dives where I'm interviewing 20+ engineers about system architecture. Currently, I struggle to capture all technical details while assessing credibility and identifying gaps. An AI that could track technical claims and flag inconsistencies would help me focus on investigation rather than note-taking."

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**
    "Inability to handle highly technical discussions with proper context. Generic transcription won't work - it needs to understand system architecture, scalability concerns, and technical debt. Also, absolute security is required given the sensitive pre-acquisition nature of my work."

30. **What integration capabilities are essential?**
    "Integration with code analysis tools, ability to reference architecture diagrams, and export to VC-standard diligence report formats. API access for custom analysis workflows would be important for specialized assessments."
