## Section 9: Open Feedback

27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "A growth-focused AI that understands SaaS metrics and can help me quickly identify what's working across my portfolio. It should recognize growth patterns, flag when similar challenges arise across clients, and help me build a playbook library. Most importantly, it needs to handle the chaos of multiple concurrent engagements."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "Weekly check-ins with portfolio companies. Currently, I spend 30 minutes before each call trying to remember where we left off, what experiments we're running, and what the metrics showed. An AI that could prep me with a 2-minute brief pulling from our last 3 conversations would be incredible."
