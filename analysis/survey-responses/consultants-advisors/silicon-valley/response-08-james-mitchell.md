27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "An AI that understands deal dynamics and can track complex multi-party negotiations. It should identify when buyer interest is waning, flag negotiation tactics, and help me understand which issues are real showstoppers vs. negotiation leverage. Absolute confidentiality and audit-quality documentation are non-negotiable."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "Management presentations during sell-side processes. Currently, we prep for hours trying to anticipate buyer questions. An AI that could analyze all prior diligence calls and identify patterns in buyer concerns would help us address issues proactively and close deals faster."

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**
    "Any security vulnerability whatsoever. M&A data is the most sensitive information in business. Also, if it couldn't handle the complexity of multi-party negotiations with NDAs, clean teams, and various access levels. The tool must be built for high-stakes confidential processes."

30. **What integration capabilities are essential?**
    "Virtual data room integration for document access, CRM for deal tracking, and ability to generate reports in investment committee formats. Calendar integration for automatic meeting documentation and billing would save significant time."
