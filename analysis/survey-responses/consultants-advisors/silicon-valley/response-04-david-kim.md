    "An AI that understands the fundraising process and can help me track complex multi-party negotiations.

Most importantly, it needs to maintain absolute confidentiality given the sensitive nature of fundraising."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "Partner meetings at VC firms. These are high-stakes conversations where every word matters. Currently, I'm so focused on the pitch that I miss subtle cues about partner dynamics. An AI that could analyze these meetings and help me understand the real concerns would be game-changing."

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**

    "DocSend for pitch deck analytics, Airtable for my investor CRM, and calendar integration to prep for upcoming meetings. Ability to generate investor updates pulling from multiple conversations would save hours."
