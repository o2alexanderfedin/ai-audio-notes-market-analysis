27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "An AI that understands user research and product strategy. It should help me synthesize stakeholder interviews, identify user patterns, and even suggest areas for deeper exploration. During workshops, it could capture not just what was said, but the energy and consensus around different ideas. Visual thinking support would be amazing."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**
