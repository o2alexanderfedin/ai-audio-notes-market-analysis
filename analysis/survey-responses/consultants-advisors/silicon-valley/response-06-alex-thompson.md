## Section 9: Open Feedback

27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "An AI that understands technical context and can help identify patterns in developer feedback across multiple API products. It should recognize technical terms, understand API design patterns, and help me spot common integration challenges. Written output is key - I need markdown-formatted technical documentation, not meeting minutes."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "Developer feedback sessions where we're discussing API design. Currently, I have to manually track all the edge cases and integration scenarios developers mention. An AI that could catalog these technical requirements and suggest API improvements based on patterns would be incredibly valuable."

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**
    "If it's optimized for business meetings rather than technical discussions. Also, if it requires synchronous meetings - much of my work is async collaboration through GitHub and Discord. The tool needs to fit my workflow, not force me into calls."

30. **What integration capabilities are essential?**
    "GitHub integration for linking insights to code changes, Discord for async discussions, and ability to generate markdown documentation. API access is non-negotiable - I'd want to build custom workflows for my specific use cases."
