27. **Describe your ideal AI assistant for consulting work:**
    "An AI that understands GTM strategy and can help identify patterns across different client engagements. It should recognize when similar challenges arise and suggest proven solutions from our playbook. During workshops, it should capture not just ideas but the energy and buy-in around different strategies. Team knowledge sharing is crucial."

28. **What specific client situation would this tool transform?**
    "GTM strategy workshops with 15+ stakeholders from product, marketing, sales, and CS. Currently, we lose so many insights in the crosstalk. An AI that could track different perspectives, identify alignment and conflicts, and help us synthesize a unified GTM strategy would be transformative."

29. **What would prevent you from adopting such a tool?**
    "If it's designed for solo consultants rather than teams. We need shared workspaces, clear permissions, and the ability to build collective knowledge. Also, if it doesn't understand marketing/growth terminology and nuances - generic business transcription isn't enough."

30. **What integration capabilities are essential?**
    "HubSpot for marketing automation insights, Segment for product analytics, and ability to pull in performance data from various martech tools. Export to beautiful presentations is crucial - our clients expect polished deliverables."
